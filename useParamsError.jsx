In React Router Dom v6, attempting to use the `useParams()` hook outside of a component rendered by a route that matches a route parameter results in an error.  The error message isn't always clear, often stating that a parameter is undefined, even though the parameter is defined in the URL. This happens because `useParams()` relies on the routing context being available, a context only provided within route components.
